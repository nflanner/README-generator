  ## Project Description:

  This is an example of the use of the README-generator command-line application. All you have to do is run using node and answer some prompts and the app will auto-generate a README.md file so you can spend more time coding + less time making READMEs!

  ## Installation Instructions:

  Go to the GitHub account linked below and `git clone ...` the README-generator repo. Then use `npm i` to install dependencies, and finally `node index.js` within the Develop folder to run the application.

  ## Usage Information:

  Open-source - use however you see fit.

  ## Contribution Guidelines:

  Contribute as much as you want, clone, fork etc. to your heart's desire. Any modifications to my personal repo will be reviewed by me :)

  ## Test Instructions:

  No test instructions.
